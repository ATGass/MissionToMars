# MissionToMars
The main idea of this exercise was to best understand how to scrape data from one webstie and import the selected pieces into another website. That way everything is cuiated to best tell the story it is designed to. In the case of "Mission to Mars" we took all relevant Mars data from NASA's site and put it in our own site..
